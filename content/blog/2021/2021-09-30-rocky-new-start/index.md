I am officially a paid prop trader! This amazing news is one that I have been working towards for a long time now, but it seems every bit of great news comes along with it, some bad news. That almost puts a wet blanket on it.

The platform I have been working on and honing my skills in because of this prop firm telling me to use it, is now telling me they no longer support this platform I am so used to and love. It's definitely a recipie for faliure, but currently exploreing other optiions like (Overcharts)[overcharts.com]. While there isn't any real documemtation on them and from other users, then their own official youtube channel. Very strange...

Well, always have to roll with the punches and keep on trucking.
