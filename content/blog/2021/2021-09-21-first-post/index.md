## Starting over

So I have probably had this "blog" for 5 years now and many failed attempts at keeping it up after a week.

I think I may have figured out how I can actually continue blogging and making it more of a habit. I think I may have been trying too hard to make it look like the amazingly ornate blogs that I often stumbleupon, from designers and engineers I could never hold a candle to. I think this has been taking out the fun in just writing and makes me focus on the failure of my asthetics.

So in order to test my hypothesis, I am going to strip it down and keep it as simple as possible. No new shiny tech stack here. Simply what I use in my day to day and what I am the most efficient working in. With the exception of Gatsby, I live on React and Typescript. I already lied, GraphQL is needed to use Gatsby and I am not getting fancy with it, as I think that could be a bump in the road on my journey to making this stick.

Wish me luck!
