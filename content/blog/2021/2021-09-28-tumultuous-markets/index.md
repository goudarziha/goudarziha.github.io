_I was born to make mistakes, not to fake perfection_ - Drake
\
\
Yesterday was my first offical day as a professional prop trader. I was given my credentials at around 3:00 pm EST and decided I wanted to trade right away. In my limited time of day trading the financial markets, I already know in the back of my head this was a bad idea and continued anyway and ended up being down \$1500.00 in a 20 minute period, which is pretty comical.
\
\
I made that money back and more during the New York open today, while I stuck to my systems and was patient. It always sucks to start off on the wrong foot, even though it can be easily amended. Money is not really the issue here, it's more emotional than anything else. Which I think can be applied to really every day life, including entrepeneurship and being a bootstrap solo developer. The emotional drain that goes into pushing any product to the finish line, or continually force yourself to work on something can be huge. It's important to understand how your emotions work. Everyone is different of course, but what I understand from learning and being a 3d party observer to my emotions, is that I need a solid system that essentially turns me into a robot.
\
\
Robots blindly do what the instructions given to them are, with no if's or but's. Building my system is essentially allowed me to act in a similar way, because I know it works. Deviation from this robot-like behavior results in less than great performance, as shown by my trading yesterday, or start-ups I have pursued that didn't cross the finish line.
\
\
Anyway, your portfolio really took a beating today, but because of my system, I made a killing... Which my robot system tells me to completely forget about to attach any emotion to this day, that will hinder future performance, as cocki-ness is just as/or way more dangerous and one who can't pull the trigger
