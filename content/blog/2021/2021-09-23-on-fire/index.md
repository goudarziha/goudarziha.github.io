## On Fire

This is already a great start, I can't believe I have actually written in this blog 3 days in a row, my longest ever! Although I don't want to jynx it, I feel this system I attempted is most sustainable way to get this going.
\
Half the battle is making it so easy for you to do it, while removing any friction surrounding that behavior. Although I might be speaking too soon...
\
Anyway, aside from my little celebration (hopefully not too pre-emptive), I wanted to use this blog as a documation of my journey into true entrepeneurship and show how anyone can really do anything. I believe a lot of success is due to luck, but placing yourself in a position to be lucky is the most important part. I have several failed start-ups already under my belt, so hopefully luck will hit soon, but will continue on none-the-less.
\
I got my first contract with a big festival in the DC area for my digital immersive marketing company, excited and dreading the amount of work that will go into this. A win is a win so i'll take it.
\
I should probably get a spell checker in markdown, but for the time being, enjoy my spelling mistakes as I remove any friction from writing here.
