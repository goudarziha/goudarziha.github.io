## Big Plans

I am already on a great streak with this blog, with the highest back-to-back streak of 2 days. I already think that less stress on editing and making this the most visually appealing blog, has already given way to the start of a beautiful system of writing.

One main purpose of this blog is to be a psudeo-jounal for documenting my journey into entrepeneurship. I like to work on software and even like to consider myself a "maker".

In order to really pursue creating my software unicorn, I really need a good cash flow. Logically that has led me down the road of day trading, where I have been extremely focused on speculating on Index futures (ES, NQ, for those in the know). Trading allows me the flexibility to generate revenue, while I try my hand at multiple SaaS projects, without the added stress of trying to feed myself.

Currently I am a software engineer at a large firm, living pretty comfortably, but soon I will need to really push out, in order to really see if I can live this lifestyle.
