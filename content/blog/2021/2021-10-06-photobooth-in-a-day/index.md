I was very fortunate to secure a place for my new fledging experiential marketing startup at one of the biggest festivals in the DC area. This has been a goal of mine since I left another experiential marketing startup.
\
\
I attempted this a few years ago, with some success, but stuck in the shadow of this former company. Covid really changed the game and really shook out a lot of previous players, leaving a large gap to fill. So this is my opportunity to take advantage of that.
\
\
The downside, is that I have to create an entire software suite for this. Which I am definitely capable of doing, but in such a short time span. This is something that has been in the back of my head, but didn't start actually developing until this week.
\
\
I have a few days off work and a couple weeks to get this done.
\
\
Let's go.
