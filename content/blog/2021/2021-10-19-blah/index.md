Failing to understand one's own mind is bound to lead to unhappiness - Marcus Aurelius

Feeling pretty blah about everything at the moment. I still do feel the need for writing in this blog, so at least I still have that going for me. It's all about the little victories amongst all the larger failures. Going through a bit of a rough patch in my personal life, which has ultimately affected other parts of my life/work.

My trading has been terrible the past few sessions. Went from a high of +6% to now just barely at 1% profit. Also close on the threshold of losing my funded prop account. So sizing down tremendoulsy is required. Psycology makes up more of trading than actual trading. I think I need to start a legit journal (other than this blog) to start writing some pre, during and post market psycological analysis. Potential new micro start-up?
