Although I don’t want to jynx it, I feel this system I attempted is most sustainable way to get this going.\n<br>\nHalf the battle is making it so easy for you to do it, while removing any friction surrounding that behavior. Although I might be speaking too soon…\n<br>\nAnyway, aside from my little celebration (hopefully not too pre-emptive), I wanted to use this blog as a documation of my journey into true entrepeneurship and show how anyone can really do anything. I believe a lot of success is due to luck, but placing yourself in a position to be lucky is the most important part. I have several failed start-ups already under my belt, so hopefully luck will hit soon, but will continue on none-the-less.\n<br>\nI got my first contract with a big festival in the DC area for my digital immersive marketing company, excited and dreading the amount of work that will go into this. A win is a win so i’ll take it.\n<br>\nI should probably get a spell checker in markdown, but for the time being, enjoy my spelling mistakes as I remove any friction from writing here.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"On Fire","date":"September 23, 2021","description":"The Streak Continues"}}},"pageContext":{"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-09-24-staying-motivated/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Staying Motivated"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-09-22-another-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Big Plans"}},"slug":"/2021/2021-09-23-on-fire/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","63159454"]}
