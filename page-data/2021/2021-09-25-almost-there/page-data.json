It is a beautiful fall day in the Washington DC area, and yet, here I am, continuing this relenentless update on the blog.\n<br>\n<br>\nI always hoped, but never Imagined my streak would be this great. You know something is starting to become a habit, when you start to feel bad when you don’t do that activity. Wether it be going to the gym or writing in a blog. Habit building requires a system and a knowledge of one-self. Not trying to hype myself as all knowing, just years of failures has led to me understanding what doesn’t work for me and that is infinitely more important that what I know works for me.\n<br>\n<br>\nBaby steps trying to get this page back up on <a href=\"https://agoudarzi.com\">agoudarzi.com</a>. Deleteing old repos, trying to get it hosted properly on github pages. Shout out to github and github pages for allowing free hosting on this site, with what appears to be unlimited storage? (might need to figure out how to abusive this). Anyone with a few hours of time to kill and really no knowledge of coding code make their own website at the cost of a little time and the price of the domain itself. This domain cost me around $1.98 originally several years ago at purchase and 2.99 per year to keep. So really just the price of a coffee a year.\n<br>\n<br>\nMight start making some guides on here</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Almost There","date":"September 25, 2021","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-09-27-weekends-dont-count/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Weekends Don't Count"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-09-24-staying-motivated/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Staying Motivated"}},"slug":"/2021/2021-09-25-almost-there/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","63159454"]}
