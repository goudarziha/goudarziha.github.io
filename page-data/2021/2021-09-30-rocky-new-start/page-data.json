This amazing news is one that I have been working towards for a long time now, but it seems every bit of great news comes along with it, some bad news. That almost puts a wet blanket on it.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe platform I have been working on and honing my skills in because of this prop firm telling me to use it, is now telling me they no longer support this platform I am so used to and love. It’s definitely a recipie for faliure, but currently exploreing other optiions like (Overcharts)[overcharts.com]. While there isn’t any real documemtation on them and from other users, then their own official youtube channel. Very strange…\n<br>\n<br>\nWell, always have to roll with the punches and keep on trucking.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rocky New Start","date":"September 30, 2021","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-10-01-diablo-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Diablo 2 Resurected"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-09-29-so-many-things/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"So Many Things"}},"slug":"/2021/2021-09-30-rocky-new-start/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","63159454"]}
