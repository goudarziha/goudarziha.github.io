This is further reinforcing my system of just writing out, whatever it may be, to reduce as much friction as possible. Still maybe too early to tell, but this has already a great feeling to keep this up, dispite not really saying much.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn the process of resurecting this blog was figuring out how Gatsby worked and how I was able to get this loaded onto github pages. What I was able to do a couple years ago, is now a complete mystery to me.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhile I couldn’t actually figure out the steps I took and I didn’t leave myself a great paper trail to follow and I definitely broke my whole page trying to overwrite the existing repo, I am still writing on this broken site. What I normally would have done in the past, was throw my hands up and completely abandon this endeavor, but my system has prevailed of taking the smallest, easiest steps to reduce friction. While this site not being up is a HUGE source of friction, writing for the sake of writing (whatever that may be) is still going on.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhile trying to navigate around Gatsby, I sometimes wonder why I have the need to make things way more difficult. This blog could really be written in one single <code class=\"language-text\">.html</code> file, but instead I am using another JS framework to make a bunch of static pages. Where is the fun in that though?\n<br>\n<br>\nIn trying to bootstrap projects (or even this blog), I have come to terms of trying to simplify as much as possible. This was/is a lot harder for me than anything else, but as I was talking about reducing friction before, <code class=\"language-text\">simplfying -= friction</code></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Staying Motivated","date":"September 24, 2021","description":"trying to stay motivated"}}},"pageContext":{"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-09-25-almost-there/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Almost There"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-09-23-on-fire/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On Fire"}},"slug":"/2021/2021-09-24-staying-motivated/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","63159454"]}
