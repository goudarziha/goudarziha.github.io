Despite my every intention and motivation for writing to this thing daily. Sometimes life gets in the way. So I wrapped up photobooth project, but unforunately got sick and actually couldn’t do the event.\n<br>\n<br>\nTrying to juggle a full time job, while day trading and trying to build another side photobooth/videobooth project left me with such little time, so sadly I couldn’t write here. That is fixed now as I have the time and still feel compelled to write in here.\n<br>\n<br>\nI have been through the pitfalls of what every developer goes through when they see a shiney new toy/framework and it usually ends up in disaster, but since I built this in gatsby. I am not the biggest fan of it and have started looking at Next.js for this blog, which can also be a static or dynamic site. Looking at all the pro’s, it would be completely crazy not to learn Next.JS and try and move the blog over there.\n<br>\n<br>\nAgain, this is usually a bad issue, but I think I would like to use Next.JS for all my future projects anyway. It’s built with React.JS, so why not?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Long Time No Talk","date":"October 16, 2021","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-10-19-blah/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blah"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-10-06-photobooth-in-a-day/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Photobooth In A Day"}},"slug":"/2021/2021-10-16-long-time-no-talk/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","63159454"]}
