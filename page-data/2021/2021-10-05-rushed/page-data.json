I write after the work day is generally over, trying to recap thoughts as they are fresh in my mind. This has also led me to not posting every day since I am generally exhausted. So I am going to try and write first thing in the morning after a nights sleep to contemplate on the learnings of the day before.\n<br>\n<br>\nTrying to learn a new charting software actaully hasn’t been too difficult, I settled on one that is actually really nice and makes me wonder why I dropped so much money on NinjaTrader, when this is a fraction of the cost with more or less of the same tools.\n<br>\n<br>\nI have also taken on a huge festival project with a video booth. I don’t have the software ready, so I have less than 2 weeks to create an experiential marketing company. Trying to simplify things as much as possible, with the flexibilty I need is a hard balance. I originally would have loved to just use supabase, but considering now I have to create a Django/React app. Going to utilize PaaS service like heroku to limit devops stuff I generally push myself through.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rushed","date":"October 05, 2021","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-10-06-photobooth-in-a-day/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Photobooth In A Day"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-10-01-diablo-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Diablo 2 Resurected"}},"slug":"/2021/2021-10-05-rushed/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","63159454"]}
