I already think that less stress on editing and making this the most visually appealing blog, has already given way to the start of a beautiful system of writing.</p>\n<p>One main purpose of this blog is to be a psudeo-jounal for documenting my journey into entrepeneurship. I like to work on software and even like to consider myself a “maker”.</p>\n<p>In order to really pursue creating my software unicorn, I really need a good cash flow. Logically that has led me down the road of day trading, where I have been extremely focused on speculating on Index futures (ES, NQ, for those in the know). Trading allows me the flexibility to generate revenue, while I try my hand at multiple SaaS projects, without the added stress of trying to feed myself.</p>\n<p>Currently I am a software engineer at a large firm, living pretty comfortably, but soon I will need to really push out, in order to really see if I can live this lifestyle.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Big Plans","date":"September 22, 2021","description":"What the future holds"}}},"pageContext":{"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-09-23-on-fire/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On Fire"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-09-21-first-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"First Post of a new blog"}},"slug":"/2021/2021-09-22-another-post/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","63159454"]}
