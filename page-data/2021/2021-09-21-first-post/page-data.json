I think I may have been trying too hard to make it look like the amazingly ornate blogs that I often stumbleupon, from designers and engineers I could never hold a candle to. I think this has been taking out the fun in just writing and makes me focus on the failure of my asthetics.</p>\n<p>So in order to test my hypothesis, I am going to strip it down and keep it as simple as possible. No new shiny tech stack here. Simply what I use in my day to day and what I am the most efficient working in. With the exception of Gatsby, I live on React and Typescript. I already lied, GraphQL is needed to use Gatsby and I am not getting fancy with it, as I think that could be a bump in the road on my journey to making this stick.</p>\n<p>Wish me luck!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First Post of a new blog","date":"September 21, 2021","description":"Starting over"}}},"pageContext":{"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-09-22-another-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Big Plans"}},"previous":null,"slug":"/2021/2021-09-21-first-post/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","63159454"]}
