You use it as a steppingstone. Close the door on the past. You don’t try to forget the mistakes, but you don’t dwell on it. You don’t let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space.” —Johnny Cash\n<br>\n<br>\nToday I blew up my prop funded account. Not a pretty sight, but taught me such a valuble lesson. The market the past month has been extremely favorable and allowed for certain trades that should have not returned gold. When that regime changes, all hell breaks loose and thus, a long losing streak. I tend to repeat a lot of the same mistakes I made before and I also recoginize a lot of emotions when I trade (generally a bad thing).\n<br>\n<br>\nI need to change things up a little bit. I am going to start a very minimal trading journal, but at the same time see if I can create some kind of viable product I could charge a subscripton fee for. There isn’t much in the way already of a journal like this, which seems more hyper-focused on trading? I think this can also translate into other high-pressure sepeculative type activty. Who Knows?\n<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I need to write things down. If anything this blog has taught me already, is the power of habit and systems. I need to move some of that energy on to my trading and treat it more like a business with plans.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blew Up","date":"October 20, 2021","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"next":null,"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-10-19-blah/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blah"}},"slug":"/2021/2021-10-20-blew-up/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","63159454"]}
