If I am being honest, I was a bit too hungover to do much of anything other than lay in front of the TV and veg out. Your body quickly loses it’s ability to deal with hangovers after 30, and what would normally be taken care of by a little brunch and hair of the dog, turns into a full day wasted.\n<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, the streak continues! After my brief heitaus, I decided I wanted to pursue an idea with a friend of mine in the real estate space. I am placing my workout app on hold at the moment. Whilst I sit and re-think the database structure for it. Long story short, I need to solve an issue revolving around creating a custom workout for x number of days and being able to log those sessions in a good way. Right now, I am mentally stuck on it, which makes me really discouraged from working on it. I am hoping to clear my head on it and have some random Eureka moment in the shower. I might also go the right of making mocks and seeing if I could validate it by emails. We shall see, but I am pretty close on the MVP, so I might as well try and finish it.\n<br>\n<br>\nOnto the real estate application. Doing my research I am starting to see how antiquated the entire system is, how Redfin is doing their work with homes, and it’s all pretty wild to me how ripe this market is for changing. Especially since this is such huge industry, why haven’t more tech companies come out of here? The app itself is pretty simple and already have market validation via the Real Estate Agent friend of mine. I have pretty good hopes for this, as we already have a few clients lined up.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Weekends Don't Count","date":"September 27, 2021","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-09-28-tumultuous-markets/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tumultuous Markets"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/2021-09-25-almost-there/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Almost There"}},"slug":"/2021/2021-09-27-weekends-dont-count/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","63159454"]}
